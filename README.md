# van_gogh
Welcome to the van_gogh repo, home to all of our logos and images. Credit to Ben for the clever repo name. Previously, all logos and images were stored in QMC (Qlik Management Console). Once a logo is uploaded there, it cannot be exported. As we migrate our Qlik to a new server, these images are essentially locked up in our old server. This repo will be a much cleaner way to store and reference logos and images, agnostic to differing Qlik servers. Another benefit of the images living outside of Qlik is the added flexibility to read them into various programming languages and BI tools.
